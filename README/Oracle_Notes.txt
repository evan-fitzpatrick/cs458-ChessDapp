The Oracle is a copy of Joe's temperature Oracle example.
In it's current state it needs three terminals to run.
There is a Client.js to provide test input.

In terminal one...

  npm install

  (You may need to npm install stockfish and npm install chess.js
  although, I think I have it set so it shouldn't be necessary.)

  npx hardhat compile

  npx hardhat node
  
In terminal two...
  
  npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deployOracle.js
  
  node Oracle/OracleServer.js
  
In terminal three...
  
  node Oracle/Client.js
  
Like Joe's example the client and server should talk back and forth.
Also, like Joe's example, the client sends requests every so many seconds,
currently it is set at every 20 seconds so you may not see output
right away.
