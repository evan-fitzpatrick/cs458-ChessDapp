The Oracle is a copy of Joe's temperature Oracle example.
In it's current state it needs three terminals to run.
There is a Client.js to provide test input.

In terminal one:

  npm install

  (You may need to npm install stockfish and npm install chess.js
  although, I think I have it set so that shouldn't be necessary.)

  npx hardhat compile

  npx hardhat node
  
In terminal two:
  
  npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deployOracle.js
  
  node Oracle/OracleServer.js
  
In terminal three:
  
  node Oracle/Client.js
  
Like Joe's example the client and server should talk back and forth.
Also, like Joe's example, the client sends requests every so many seconds,
currently it is set at every 20 seconds so you won't see output
right away. The server will validate moves with chess.js and ask Stockfish
for the next move it would like to make. The server takes a move and
a fenString and returns a fenString. If you want Stockfish to pick the next
move send 'stockfish' as the next move. Example...

Input:

  'b1c3', 'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1'
  
  or...
  
  'stockfish', 'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1'
  
Output:

  'rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1'
