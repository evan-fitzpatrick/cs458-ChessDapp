Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN)

Examples:

    Starting Position (no moves made)...

        rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1
    
    White moves knight from b1 to c3...
    
        rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1
    
    Black moves pawn from e7 to e5...
    
        rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq e6 0 2
    
    White moves knight from g1 to f3...
    
        rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/2N2N2/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2
    
First Argument:
    The first argument lists the placement of pieces on the board. Pieces are listed 
    starting with the eighth rank first file (top left corner) and progressing by ranks 
    to the first rank eighth file (bottom right corner). Lowercase letters describe black 
    pieces, uppercase letters describe white pieces. Empty squares are denoted by numbers 
    listing the number of empty squares.

Second Argument:
    The second argument indicates who has next move. This argument will always be lowercase,
    "w" for white, "b" for black.

Third Argument:
    The third argument indicates castling ability. White uppercase letters followed by
    black lowercase letters. "K" for kingside followed by "Q" for queenside. If no castling 
    is available, then the argument is shown as "-".

Forth Argument:
    The forth argument lists en passant targets. If a pawn makes an initial two square advance 
    and is eligible for an en passant capture, then the forth argument lists the square behind 
    the pawn (the square the pawn moved over) that is an eligible move. If no en passant captures 
    are available, then the argument is shown as "-".

Fifth Argument:
    The fifth argument counts the number of half moves both players have made since the last pawn 
    advance or piece capture. This argument is useful for enforcing the 50 move draw rule. When 
    the counter reaches 100 (each player has made 50 moves) the game ends in a draw.

Sixth Argument:
    The sixth argument counts the number of full moves completed in the game. This counter is 
    incremented by one every time black makes a move. This counter starts at 1.

Problems with this Notation:
    FEN does not provide enough information to decide whether or not a draw by threefold 
    repetition may be offered or accepted.
